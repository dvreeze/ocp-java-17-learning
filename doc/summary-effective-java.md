# Summary of Effective Java, 3rd Edition

Besides learning the OCP material, it makes a lot of sense to be familiar with the content of the book
Effective Java (3rd Edition), authored by Joshua Bloch. Whereas the OCP material teaches us about Java itself,
the book Effective Java teaches us about how to use java *idiomatically*. More precisely, the book is about
writing *clear, correct, usable, robust, flexible and maintainable programs*, as the book says in the introduction.
Performance will typically follow relatively easily once writing such programs.

This document summarizes the book Effective Java, following the exact structure of the book in terms of chapters
and items per chapter.

**Of course this summary in no way replaces the book itself. It is absolutely worth the money to buy the book itself.**

## Chapter 2. Creating and Destroying Objects

### Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

Public *static factory methods* have some advantages compared to constructors:
* they have names (which may increase readability)
* they are not required to create a new object on each invocation
* they can return an object of any subtype of the return type
* the class of the returned object can ever vary from call to call based on the input parameters
* the class of the returned object need not exist when writing the class containing the static factory method (thus supporting *service provider frameworks*, e.g. JDBC)

In other words, static factory methods offer *flexibility*. That is, they have *expressive power*.

Some limitations of static factory methods are:
* classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed (which may be desirable, encouraging the use of composition instead of inheritance)
* they are harder to find in the API than constructors (although there are some common names for static factory methods)

### Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters

Suppose object construction (through a constructor or static factory method) requires a lot of parameters. Consider using
the *Builder pattern* (especially if many construction parameters are optional). The Builder pattern can even be used for creating objects
of different types in a class hierarchy.

The Builder pattern is more clear than the telescoping constructor pattern. It is certainly more safe than Java Beans, because it can
make sure that objects are created in a *consistent state*. Note that Java Beans (with getters and setters) cannot be used
for immutable classes.

In other words, the Builder pattern can help achieve *clarity* and *correctness*.

### Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type

A singleton class has *precisely 1 instance*. This can be enforced by a private constructor, in combination with a public
static field or factory method returning the single instance. Yet mind potential attacks through reflection, and vulnerabilities
using Java (de)serialization (consider using a readResolve method, while making all instance fields transient).

A *single-element enum* also has uses these techniques, while protecting against reflection and serialization attacks
that lead to multiple instantiations. A single-element enum is also concise. It cannot extend another superclass, however.

So a single-element enum helps achieve *clarity* and *correctness* in enforcing the singleton property.

Singleton classes (including single-element enums) can make its clients difficult to test, however (since the singleton
is typically hard to mock).

### Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor

Some classes ("utility classes") contain only static methods (and maybe static fields), and are not meant to be instantiated.
Non-instantiation can be enforced by a private constructor (that is not called), accompanied by a clarifying comment.
Note that the private constructor also prevents the creation of subclasses.

Again, this is about *clarity* (and *correctness*).

### Item 5: Prefer dependency injection to hardwiring resources

Many classes have *underlying resources as dependencies*. Implementing them as utility classes or singleton classes that
create the underlying resource themselves is quite inflexible and untestable. It is much better to *pass the resource
in the constructor* when creating a new instance of the class. In other words, use a form of *dependency injection*,
where the underlying resource is a *dependency* that is *injected* on creating an instance of the class.

This form of dependency injection also helps preserve *immutability*, which helps enforce *correctness* and *clarity*.

It enhances *flexibility*, *reusability* and *testability* of a class.

Dependency injection "clutter" can be reduced by the use of the dependency injection framework.

### Item 6: Avoid creating unnecessary objects

Object creation on the JVM is *cheap in general*. Still, *some objects are expensive to create*, and this object creation
is not always visible. For example, consider matching strings against regular expressions. A reused `Pattern` (holding
a compiled regular expression) may dramatically improve execution speed compared to repeated implicit `Pattern` creation
under the hood.

Immutable objects can always be reused. For example, using a `String` constructor passing a `String` literal as constructor
argument makes no sense at all. *Immutable classes offering static factory methods* may also help avoid unnecessary
creation of different equal instances.

Mind the runtime costs of *unintentional autoboxing* of primitives.

On the other hand, creating own object pools is typically a bad idea. So is lazy initialisation of fields.
Program clarity should not suffer, and creating additional objects for clarity, simplicity or flexibility is generally
a good thing. Correctness should never be sacrificed, so when *defensive copies* are needed, we should never avoid them
in order to increase performance at the expense of correctness.
